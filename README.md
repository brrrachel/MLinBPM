# Resource Allocation

This repository hosts all data for the Machine Learning in Business Process Management Seminar Project by Rachel Brabender and Oliver Clasen.

## Setup Python
We are using some libraries which are not part of the normal python libraries. Therefore, we wrote a setupFile which will install those.
```
cd code
bash setupPython.sh
```
## Run Allocator
The code below executes the simulation with the Q-Value Allocator.
```
cd code
pyhton3 main.py -q
```
For more information on how to execute the code please use the --help command
